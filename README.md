This project had two projects. The main web applicaiton Codebase/CaliforniaHealth and Codebase/CaliforniaHealthAPI. The API rpoject will # be required to create the microservices. You will not need any database. The exercise will aim to see how the microservices are created #
and consumed by the front end web application

The web application will require value for an appsettings variable called "restService". This will be the URl of the API endpoint

The web application also refers to a API key. This may or may not be used, depending on the student's interest. It is not the aim of the # exercise
