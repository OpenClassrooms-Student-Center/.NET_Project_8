# .NET_Project_8
This repository has two projects. The project, CaliforniaHealth, is for the web application and the CaliforniaHealthAPI is for the API that will need to be refactored to create the microservices.  

The web application will require value for an appsettings variable called "restService". This will be the URl of the API endpoint

The web application also refers to a API key. This may or may not be used, depending on the student's interest. It is not the aim of the # exercise
